As the main purpose of the app is to demonstrate me finding and fixing bugs throughout development,
I will focus on the minimum steps required to do this

Part 1

Enums
Backend Models (Account, Project, Bug, Comment, UserPermission, UserIcon) (done)
Frontend page template (navbar and credits footer) (in progress)
Controllers (Auth, Account, Project, Bug)
View models (Account, Project, ProjectPreview, Bug, BugPreview)
DTOs (User, Project, Bug)
Pages (Main, Browse (without filter), Registration, Account recovery, password reset, create new project,
view project, view project bugs, add bug, view bug, credits page, not found)
Components (Project preview, project form, bug form, registration form, username tag, go back template)
Page templates (view project, view bug)
Install the following (Axios, Quasar, Vuelidate, Pinia)

Part 2
Controllers (comment, user permissions)
View models (Comment, UserPermissions)
DTOs (ProjectFilter, Comment, UserPermission)
Pages (Browse page (with filter), Project settings, bug comments, bug settings, user profile, user settings, user projects, admin list)
Templates (User page)

Future plans
show error message when user goes to project they cannot see

Next step: create registration system:
    - add tooltips to form
    - add email validation to form

Noted glitches:
- If the user logs in, logs out and logs in again, the sidebar remains open
- JWTs only last for 10 minutes before logging the user off
