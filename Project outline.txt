As the main purpose of the app is to demonstrate me finding and fixing bugs throughout development,
I will focus on the minimum steps required to do this

Part 1

Enums
Backend Models (Account, Project, Bug, Comment, UserPermission, UserIcon) (done)
Frontend page template (navbar and credits footer) (in progress)
Controllers (Auth, Account, Project, Bug)
View models (Account, Project, ProjectPreview, Bug, BugPreview)
DTOs (User, Project, Bug)
Pages (Main, Browse (without filter), Registration, Account recovery, password reset, create new project,
view project, view project bugs, add bug, view bug, credits page, not found)
Components (Project preview, project form, bug form, registration form, username tag, go back template)
Page templates (view project, view bug)
Install the following (Axios, Quasar, Vuelidate, Pinia) 

Part 2
Controllers (comment, user permissions)
View models (Comment, UserPermissions)
DTOs (ProjectFilter, Comment, UserPermission)
Pages (Browse page (with filter), Project settings, bug comments, bug settings, user profile, user settings, user projects, admin list)
Templates (User page)

Future plans
show error message when user goes to project they cannot see

Next steps: Project view
  show the following messages for unauthorised views
  - if project is for logged in users only, and the user isn't logged in, show prompt for user to log in
  - if project is restricted and the user isn't logged in, show prompt saying user needs to log in to see if they can access the project
  - if project is restricted and the user is logged in, show message saying they cannot view the project
  - if project fails to load, show error message


Noted glitches:
- If the user logs in, logs out and logs in again, the sidebar remains open
- It is possible for someone to create an account with all white spaces (e.g., "    ")
- There is no "valid format" for a user name
- Form fields show error messages when user types in them for the first time
- User is logged out when moving to another page and the Backend is disabled
- Password reset error is briefly visible when valid ID and token is supplied
- Users are not redirected when logging while on a page only non-logged in users are supposed to see
- Log in prompt is briefly visible when accessing a restricted page
- User icon is not aligned with buttons in navbar
- Page elements do not refresh when logging out
- Possibly show unique error messages when viewing a project that does not exist
